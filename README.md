# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data aboutbank marketing. We seek to predict...

The best performing model was VotingEnsemble

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
VotingEnsemble was the best model based on the accuracy metric. The accuracy score for the model was 0.9172382397572079
Hyperparameters used for this model were 

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**
The model generated by AutoML had accuracy slighlty higher than the HyperDrive model. 0.9172382397572079 for autoML and 0.9147192716236723 for HyperDrive
The architecture is different as one is VotingEnsemble where as the other is SKLearn

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
